# All String Method use here:

                    # Lower()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.lower()
# print(res)

                    # Upper()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.upper()
# print(res)

                    # Capitalize()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.capitalize()
# print(res)


                    # strip()
# a = "this is a car but green color is not better look"

# res = a.strip() #strip is remove the whitespace and also give the argument
# print(res)
                    #split()
# a = "this is a car but green color is not better look"

# #The split() method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
# res = a.split(",") 
# print(res)

                    #join()
# The join() method in Python is used to join elements of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) into a single string using a specified separator.
# a = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
# res = "".join(a)
# print(res)
                    
                    #replace()

# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# print(res)

                           #find()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.find("a") #find() method work just like index means when i give "a" then output is 8 means index.
# print(res)

                           #count()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.count("a") # count() method find how many time occurance a in the string
# print(res)
                        #startswith()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"
# res = a.startswith("car")    #startswith() method just check the give argument is true or false in started
# print(res)

                        #endswith()
# a = "This is a Car but Green Color is not Better Look"

# res = a.endswith("ook") #endswith() method check last in the give sentence
# print(res)


                        #length()
# a = "this is a car"
# res = len(a)
# print(res)


                        #format()
# Name = "arsul"
# a = "my name is {}"
# res = a.format(Name)
# print(res)
                         
                        #center()

# a = "arsul"
# res = a.center(10,"*")
# print(res)


    
                        #casefold()

# name = "ARSUL"
# res = name.casefold() #casefold() basically convert upper case letter in lower case.
# print(res)

                       #ljust()

# a = "hello world"
